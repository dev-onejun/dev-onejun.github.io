## Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Explanation
  - [Reference 1](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/)

- Difference between Prim's algorithm
  - Dijkstra's algorithm can work on both directed and undirected graphs.
  - Prim's algorithm only works on undirected graphs.
